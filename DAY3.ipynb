            "Bonjour! The capital of France is a no-brainer, n'est-ce pas? It's the City of Light, the one and only Paris! Specifically, the capital of France is located on the Seine River, in the Île-de-France region. Did you know that Paris is built on a series of small islands, and the Seine River flows through the city for approximately 7.8 kilometers? In fact, the city's name \"Paris\" is derived from the ancient Celtic tribe known as the Parisii, who inhabited the area in the 3rd century BC. Fascinating, don't you think?\n",
            "Bien sûr! The population of Paris is a dynamic figure, but as of my last update, the city's metropolitan area is home to approximately 12.2 million people. However, if you're asking about the population within the city limits, the answer is around 2.1 million people. And did you know that the Paris metropolitan area is one of the largest urban agglomerations in Europe, covering an area of over 14,000 square kilometers?\n",
            "Bien sûr! Paris is a treasure trove of iconic landmarks, n'est-ce pas? Let me see if I can recall them all... Ah yes, there's the Eiffel Tower, of course! The Iron Lady, as she's affectionately known, is an engineering marvel and a symbol of French culture. Did you know that the Eiffel Tower stands at an impressive 324 meters tall and was built for the 1889 World's Fair? It's made up of over 18,000 pieces of wrought iron and weighs a staggering 10,000 tons!\n",
            "\n",
            "And then there's the Arc de Triomphe, a monumental arch that honors the soldiers who fought and died for France. Did you know that the Arc de Triomphe is 50 meters tall and has been the site of numerous high-profile events, including the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier? It's also the starting point of the famous Champs-Élysées avenue.\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, no discussion of Paris would be complete without mentioning the Louvre Museum, which is home to some of the world's most famous artworks, including the Mona Lisa. Did you know that the Louvre is one of the largest and most visited museums in the world, with a collection of over 550,000 works of art?\n",
            "\n",
            "And let's not forget the Notre-Dame Cathedral, a beautiful example of Gothic architecture that dates back to the 12th century. Unfortunately, it suffered a devastating fire in 2019, but it's currently undergoing restoration.\n",
            "\n",
            "Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the Pont des Arts, a pedestrian bridge that offers stunning views of the Seine River. Did you know that the Pont des Arts is made up of over 6,000 tons of steel and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Paris?\n",
            "\n",
